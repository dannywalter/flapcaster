# Flapcaster

Flapcaster is a minimalist Flappy Bird inspired game built with HTML5 canvas and the Farcaster FArcade SDK. Fly the alien through gaps in the obstacles and try to survive as long as possible.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download its contents.
2. No build step is required because the game runs entirely in the browser.

## Running the Game

Open `index.html` with any modern web browser. You can double-click the file or serve the directory with a static file server and navigate to the page. Use the mouse or touch to flap and avoid crashing into obstacles.
