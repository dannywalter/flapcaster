# Flapcaster

Flapcaster is a minimalist Flappy Bird inspired game built with HTML5 canvas and the Farcaster FArcade SDK. Fly the alien through gaps in the obstacles and try to survive as long as possible.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository or download its contents.
2. No build step is required because the game runs entirely in the browser.

## Running the Game

Open `index.html` with any modern web browser. You can double-click the file or serve the directory with a static file server and navigate to the page. Use the mouse or touch to flap and avoid crashing into obstacles.


## Cheat Codes

While playing you can type secret codes on your keyboard to enable extra features. When a valid code is entered a short message will appear at the top of the screen.

Available codes:

- **GOLD** – turns the alien a shiny gold color.
- **ALIENP** – loads an alternate alien sprite.

More codes can be added by editing the `CHEATS` object inside `index.html`.
